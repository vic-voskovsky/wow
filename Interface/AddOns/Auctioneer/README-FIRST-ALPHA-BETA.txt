There is no support to import your old auctioneer data in alpha or beta releases. Back up your old data first (for ALL mods in the auctioneer pack) by moving it out of the saved variable directory (preferably right out of the WoW tree). You'll find these in %gamedir%\WTF\Acount\%accountname%\SavedVariables\

Do this because we cannot guarantee that the DB format (or SV for any of our mods, for that matter) in any alpha or beta will be permanently set in stone.

If you don't understand this, you probably shouldn't be using alpha or beta mods.

There are known current issues, but this doesn't mean we're hard at work fixing them right at this moment. We could well be working hard on the backend rather than concentrating on UI fluff ;)

Some of the known current issues for 3.9.xxxx:

. Search Auctions tab->Search->Competion throws an error message regarding 'logicalColumn'.
. Posting auctions only gives the option for a BottomScanner price.

No doubt there are more known and recorded elsewhere, others known and not recorded, those not known, heisenbugs and others.

If you're going to report a bug to us on our alpha/beta builds, please ensure you're using the latest development version from http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl
